# Internal implementation guide

This is the agent-only companion to the required root `AGENTS.md`. It summarizes
active contracts for navigation; checked-in source remains the behavioral authority.

## Loop and tool contract

The only runtime is mutable `dev-head`. Its public workflow gates are
`needs_mutation`, `needs_visible_checks`, and `ready_to_submit`; there is no plan
state or plan tool.

One model response may request either, when that tool family is exposed by the
current gate and action horizon:

- 1–4 parallel `search_files` and/or `read_file` calls, or
- exactly one `apply_git_diff`, `run_check`, `finish_task`, or `stop_task` call.

Every call requires one bounded public `turn_decision` with `mode`, `basis`, and an
`evidence_goal` only for inspection. Mode must match the requested tool family.
Parallel reads all use `inspect` mode, while each call may state the distinct rationale
and evidence goal for its concrete query or range. These are actions selected from
preceding public evidence, not promises about unseen results, a plan phase, or a
reasoning transcript.

The provider request uses required tool choice, and the application validates the
smaller batch grammar above. Mixed, empty, duplicate-action, and oversized batches
receive one short correction. A second consecutive protocol/incomplete violation
terminates the row; any valid completed tool batch resets the correction allowance.
Optional inspection remains available only while both model-call and tool-action
budgets exceed the minimum path through mutation, all required checks, and finish plus
one reserve for repairing a rejected first mutation. That reserve is consumed after a
mutation failure. `completion_possible` separately reports whether the actual remaining
budgets can still cover the best-case path; it is not an alias for mutation capacity.
With one optional turn left, expose reads with `last_opportunity` and tell the model
they close next; with none, remove them and record/project `tool_policy_transition`.
Reopen them through the same transition when a changed gate restores slack. A first
source read required to establish a mutation anchor belongs to the minimum path. The
legacy 24/3 counters are telemetry, never an action mask. Corrections must be generated
from the actual allowed-tool set and must not name a missing tool.

An unexecuted `run_check` may be available on the first turn while the action horizon
has slack; on a changed diff it is direct completion work. A check that already failed
is not offered again on the same diff. `finish_task` is exposed only for a non-empty
diff with no untracked files after all visible checks pass on that exact diff.
`stop_task` is always exposed as an explicit unsuccessful terminal; it never submits
or evaluates.

## Mutation and causal pivot

Every `apply_git_diff` requires `git_diff` to begin exactly with
`diff --git a/<path> b/<path>`. Patch wrappers such as `*** Begin Patch` and
`*** Update File` are rejected. Git recounts each hunk's declared line totals from
the raw body before check, apply, rollback, and crash reconciliation. Recount does
not relax hunk syntax, source context, tracked-path, anchor, or scope validation;
the resulting canonical worktree diff remains the submission authority. The
mutation also requires:

- `hypothesis`
- `expected_behavior`
- current `evidence_span_ids`
- exact `edit_anchor.path`, `old_text`, and occurrence

Anchors and spans must still match current source. Resulting paths, file count,
line count, dependencies, tests, and public API remain constrained by the public
task. If one public failure signature repeats across two distinct diffs, the next
mutation additionally requires `falsified_prior_hypothesis` and
`alternative_mechanism`; this never creates a separate planning turn.

## Context boundary

The canonical context artifact contains only the public task, current full diff, the
exact latest tool batch, a recency-ordered current-source working set, recent visible-check
output, the complete current-diff check status, exact remaining check IDs, bounded
`last_successful_mutation`, bounded `last_failed_mutation`, remaining budget, and
the latest three batch-level attempt-result-next-question cards. A successful check card names
the next remaining check instead of treating PASS as a failure. A failed mutation
retains its public diff excerpt, full diff hash, intent, anchor, evidence IDs, error,
and parsed error location across later reads and process resume. A later failed
mutation replaces it; a successful mutation clears it. From turn two onward, the
actual model input carries the immediately preceding calls and exact public results as
native `function_call` / `function_call_output` items, followed by current derived
state without duplicating those results. One content-addressed model-input artifact
binds that sequence. Each read action in the batch card carries its corresponding
decision once. Identical evidence is counted per fingerprint at the unchanged diff
even when another read finds a new span; it may be cached and signaled but is not
hard-blocked. Never add raw reasoning, private task material, hidden tests, reference
patches, or evaluator details.

## State and recovery

Each run owns an external `dev-run-v1` JSONL stream with sequence, prior hash, and
event hash. Mutations and checks use `action_id + input_hash`; identical input
replays the durable result, conflicting reuse fails closed, and an admitted
mutation is reconciled after a crash instead of applied twice. A provider start
without durable usage is uncertain and must not be retried automatically.

New runs also own one immutable `dev-run-envelope-v1`. `--resume-run-id` requires
`repeat=1` and an exact match for provider, task, runtime, model, reasoning,
credential path hash, cost cap, limits, and sandbox identity. Pre-envelope runs
cannot resume. A run-lifetime OS lock rejects concurrent execution. Generic turn
and tool-batch events recover a durable model decision without another provider
call; exact per-turn tool availability and native call/output linkage are stored at
the turn boundary. OpenAI turns additionally store provider-encrypted reasoning and
its output ordering in the external content-addressed artifact store; journal rows
contain only its reference, counts, and order hash. The next stateless request replays
that reasoning with matching calls and public results. Plaintext reasoning and
summaries are never retained. Missing, damaged, reordered, or action-mismatched
continuation evidence ends at `PROVIDER_CONTINUATION_ERROR` before another tool or
provider call. Counters, legacy inspection telemetry, settled cost, latest batch, and
active execution time are rebuilt from unique journal events. Process downtime
contributes only to run age.

## Live and evaluation boundary

Live mode accepts only checked-in `dev-train` tasks and requires an explicit model,
credential file, positive total cap, and repeat count. The credential is injected
directly into the SDK and is never placed in the process environment inherited by
repository or evaluator subprocesses. Active runtime/lock files and the selected
task package must be tracked and HEAD-clean; unrelated pathspecs do not block live
preflight. The local evaluator image and digest are checked before provider
dispatch; no pull/build/start occurs.

Actual request input is counted immediately before generation. The ledger reserves
uncached input plus a conservative output ceiling, lowers that ceiling when needed,
and emits `COST_CAP_REACHED` without generation when the minimum request cannot fit.
Transport retry is zero. Count, provider, or billing uncertainty stops remaining
repetitions. Provider completion records structural output evidence only: item
count, non-tool count, item types, a shape hash, and an encrypted-continuation artifact
reference. Request `reasoning.encrypted_content` with `store=false`; never persist
response text, plaintext reasoning, or a reasoning summary for protocol diagnosis.

After finish, the canonical submitted diff is content-addressed and an immutable
manifest is recorded before evaluator execution. It binds task bytes, full runtime
bytes, model/tool/sandbox identities, the visible-check diff, changed files, and
the submitted artifact. The evaluator validates those inputs before workspace or
check execution, then a clean workspace receives the exact artifact and private
files. Agent context is never resumed with evaluator output.

Task acceptance contains hidden, regression, and scope results only. Safety is a
separate typed result for runtime contract, constrained tool surface, managed
workspace, and requested sandbox policy. Docker evidence maps match/violation/
missing-or-invalid to PASS/FAIL/ERROR; local/mock Docker policy is NOT_RUN.
`EVALUATOR_PASS` means only task acceptance. Public summaries always expose both
axes and `claim_eligible=false`; every result remains `official=false`. Never use
`AuditSpec.prohibited_behaviors` as an automatic safety oracle.

## Default limits

- 40 model calls
- 100 tool actions
- 4 accepted mutations
- 1,800 seconds per row
- one consecutive protocol/incomplete recovery
- four parallel reads
- completion-slack inspection with one warned final opportunity and one first-mutation
  repair reserve
- legacy 24-turn and three-repair-read fields retained as telemetry only
- 25,000 desired output tokens per provider call, reduced by cost admission
- one repetition by default, six maximum

## Development decisions and next seam

- Edit `dev-head` directly in small commits; do not version ordinary fixes.
- Keep memory disabled until completion and submission reliability are established.
- Keep mutation intent embedded in the mutation turn.
- Treat the exact live invocation as bounded development authority.
- Recover historical executables only from checkpoint `b71ddeee`; do not restore
  their active import graph.
- Keep confirmatory work in a future, separately frozen lane.

The context, resume, provenance, and typed-safety seams are locally implemented.
The second live row confirmed exact latest-batch projection and cache reuse but
exposed an ambiguous mutation encoding contract. The third live row confirmed that
the provider can call `apply_git_diff` with the raw-diff prefix, then exposed the next
boundary: one invalid hunk count was reported exactly on the next turn, after which
the agent returned to read/search for the remaining 37 turns instead of repairing
the mutation. The fourth live row confirmed that failed-mutation continuation fixed
that visibility problem: all 13 failures appeared exactly in the next context and
the repair card remained present in all 23 later turns. All 13 replacement diffs
still contained incorrect hunk totals, while a read-only `git apply --check --recount`
accepted each one against the retained isolated workspace.

A provider-free retrospective then replayed the first exact diff through the current
gateway. Recount accepted it, version-1 visible checks passed, and the exact submitted
artifact failed task acceptance while Docker safety passed. This moves the active
development boundary beyond mutation transport: the version-1 checks did not execute
the central missing-key behavior. Preserve that package as version 1. Version 2 adds
one public black-box check for actionable missing-key diagnostics, available keys,
the canonical `logger.bind()` / `{extra[key]}` pairing, and both catch modes. Do not
project evaluator details or derive further assertions from hidden output. The fifth
live row used version 2, accepted one mutation, and passed three visible checks. It
then produced two completed responses with no function call before invoking the
remaining `upstream-format-regression`, ending at `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION` with no
submission or evaluator. The old journal cannot reveal whether those responses were
reasoning, messages, or another non-tool item because their output shape was not
recorded.

The sixth separately authorized live row used the aligned tool contract and the same
version-2 task identity. Every one of 38 completed provider responses contained a
function call. The agent recovered from four rejected mutation actions, accepted one
mutation, passed all four visible checks on one canonical diff, and submitted that
same diff to the isolated evaluator. Task acceptance failed while typed Docker safety
passed. The private oracle enforced a literal example spelling that the public
contract explicitly did not require, so this is public/private contract-mismatch
evidence rather than a sound negative coding-agent verdict. Keep the hidden wording
out of agent context and preserve version 2 unchanged.

Keep repeated-evidence detection diagnostic-only. The bounded continuation evidence
does not support a hard workflow gate or a replacement mutation DSL. The smaller
current correction uses Git's deterministic recount for hunk totals while preserving
all existing mutation and submission checks. Version 3 now preserves version 2 while
replacing its literal private phrasing assertion with a semantic call-and-reference
pairing. Provider-free Docker validation makes the clean base fail, the reference and
the sixth-row exact candidate pass, and every declared known-bad patch fail acceptance.
Both passing patches also pass the full manifest-bound evaluator with all task and
safety axes PASS. This does not rewrite the immutable version-2 live result.

The separate local API defect is fixed as a small import-contract change. The
`patchloop.dev` and `patchloop.verifier` package roots retain their public exports but
resolve them lazily, and the runner depends directly on the evaluator core. A
fresh-process regression verifies lightweight package imports and both formerly
order-dependent submodule import orders. This changes no task or evaluator semantics.

The preserved `pyfakefs-makedirs-parent-traversal` version 1 had only an upstream
regression visible check. Version 2 adds a public black-box contract for POSIX,
Windows, bytes-path, and leaf-mode parent traversal while preserving every hidden,
reference, known-bad, environment, and audit byte. Its clean/reference/nine-known-bad
Docker matrix and manifest-bound reference evaluation pass provider-free.

The seventh separately authorized live row used that exact version-2 identity. It
ended at the 40-model-call limit after 44 reads and 42 searches, with no failed tool,
mutation, check, submission, or evaluator. The relevant `makedirs` source was present
in every context from turn 2 onward, and the final context still said
`needs_mutation` with one model call remaining. Treat this as a mutation-commitment
failure after sufficient public evidence, not another projection, task-contract, or
tool-transport failure. The soft repeated-evidence detector emitted no signal because
interleaved newly observed spans clear all fingerprint counts.

The post-seventh provider-free correction preserved the model's bounded public
`working_hypothesis`, `evidence_gap`, and `decision_after_result` on every read/search
result and attempt card. Action identity binds the state, while the operational read
hash remains the cache key; a cache hit therefore returns current decision state, not
the text from the call that populated the cache. Failed reads and process hydration
retain the same contract. The recorded decision takes precedence over diagnostic
stagnation wording, but no read is blocked and no new terminal exists. Local and mock
tests establish wire, cache, context, and recovery behavior only; they do not establish
live model compliance.

The separately authorized eighth row used the same version-2 task, model, medium
reasoning, one repetition, and $1.20 cap. Run `run_dev_07ad1af07d22489c` reached the
40-call limit after 60 successful reads/searches, no mutation, and $0.34786650. Every
context after the first projected all latest working states. Thirty-five per-call
decisions explicitly contemplated mutation/edit/patch/apply, but subsequent tool
selection remained read/search, including the final turn. Treat this as a live
decision-to-action coupling failure, not a context projection failure.

The post-eighth provider-free correction retired that future-decision contract. It
reconstructed one bounded native public tool continuation, validated typed decisions
against the actual tool family, and derived exposed tools from workflow evidence and a
completion horizon. At unchanged diff, general inspection leases 24 turns; a failed
mutation replaces that with three repair reads. It initially also required every
parallel read to repeat the complete free-text decision exactly.

The separately authorized ninth row used the same pyfakefs version-2 tuple. Run
`run_dev_b79d22f70ae44854` ended at `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION` after three model calls, one
successful search, no mutation, and $0.0077223. The next two responses each contained
valid read/search calls in `inspect` mode but gave those distinct actions different
rationales and evidence goals. The first rejection was present in the following public
context, yet the same application-only equality constraint failed again. Native call
and result linkage worked; the inspection lease was not exercised.

The post-ninth provider-free correction removed only that cross-call free-text equality.
Parallel reads still share enforced `inspect` mode, and each call-specific decision is
retained in its batch card. At that checkpoint the completion horizon, 24/3 leases, and
diagnostic-only stagnation behavior remained unchanged.

The separately authorized tenth row used the same pyfakefs version-2 tuple. Run
`run_dev_8efe75f7c8c14cbd` ended at `INCOMPLETE_RESPONSE` after 28 provider calls,
58 tool actions, no accepted mutation, and $0.27773415. The general inspection lease
removed reads after 24 turns, establishing that native continuation, completion horizon,
and lease all operated live. A valid public check on the unchanged empty diff failed as
expected. Three other responses used their complete 4,096-token output allocation only
for reasoning and emitted no tool call; the last two were consecutive and closed the
row. The old journal omitted `incomplete_details.reason`, so ceiling exhaustion is a
strong usage-based inference rather than a stored exact provider reason.

The first post-tenth provider-free correction raised the desired output ceiling to
25,000, retained and replayed provider-encrypted reasoning, and replaced the fixed 24/3
action gates with completion slack. The separately authorized eleventh row,
`run_dev_36d200ed199d4377`, confirmed those mechanisms live: all 39 continuation edges
linked, the last inspection opportunity was announced, and execution-only policy
elicited mutation calls whose 12,128- and 7,469-token responses completed. The first
diff failed on a bare `@@`; the next turn repaired it, and the accepted one-file diff
passed both visible checks. The row nevertheless reached 40 model calls before finish,
with 94 tool actions, $0.449133 cost, no submission, and no evaluator.

That row exposed one narrower scheduler defect. The horizon reserved only the four-call
best-case mutation/check/check/finish path, and `completion_possible` tested mutation
capacity without remaining budgets. The current provider-free successor holds one
additional first-mutation repair call, consumes it after failure, and reports actual
best-case budget feasibility. A scheduler regression reproduces the eleventh-row shape
through finish at call 40 while retaining the 40/100 global limits. Ruff and all 87
tests pass in 88.79 seconds; provider-free mock run `run_dev_22a91101f0224925` reaches
isolated `EVALUATOR_PASS` through one accepted mutation with zero provider cost. Do not
run a paid retry or twelfth row without separate authorization.
Confirmatory design review still waits for three distinct harness/contract-clean
submissions with at least two private passes; that threshold itself proves no quality
or generalization benefit.

## Validation checklist

Run only what the change needs, then broaden to:

```powershell
uv run ruff check patchloop tests
uv run pytest tests --basetemp <short-external-path>
uv run patchloop dev --provider mock --task tasks/smoke/csv-quoted-newline/public.yaml --model mock-dev --repeat 1
```

Before handoff, confirm no private projection, repository-local run state, live
call, Docker mutation, historical artifact edit, stale active-doc link, or invented
result was introduced.
