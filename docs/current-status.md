# Current status

Updated: 2026-09-27. This is a replaceable snapshot of current decisions, not an
append-only log. Source code owns runtime behavior; this page owns current priorities.
Read [history](history/README.md) only for a specific evidence question.

## Direction

Build an agent that understands public tasks, makes correct repairs, checks changed
and preserved behavior, and submits reliably within bounded cost and time. Start
with observed failures, diagnose causes, and select the smallest useful improvement.
Research questions can arise during diagnosis; reusable method claims follow evidence.
There is no commitment to demonstrate a memory effect or another preselected method.

Comparisons answer concrete causal questions when needed. Successful plumbing,
note/probe use, or submission alone does not establish better task solving.
Simplifying an ineffective mechanism is a valid next step.

## Active runtime and working baseline

- `dev-head` is the sole active mutable runtime; every run is `official=false`.
- The chosen performance baseline is `gpt-5.4-2026-03-05`, xhigh, 25,000 output tokens.
  The last live comparison used execution checkpoint `5d74710`.
  These selected settings are not a statement of CLI defaults.
- Baseline options: segmented-v1, result-or-size-v1 boundaries, brief-v1, probes
  enabled / probe-policy none, repair-recheck, protected-v1 inspection, and
  per-call-v1 completion-cost admission.
- Limits: 40 model calls, 100 tool actions, 4 accepted mutations, 1,800 seconds;
  paid work also needs an exact separately authorized invocation-wide cost cap.
- Cross-run memory, held-out tuning, and claim execution are disabled. Bounded
  run-local notes and public state remain available.
- Historical Rapid executables are absent. Existing history and evidence are immutable.

Keep the chosen baseline fixed while diagnosing a failure. Any proposed change
should identify the mechanism it tests; task-specific repair hints are excluded.
See [operations](operations.md) for commands and actual CLI defaults, and the
[implementation guide](../.agent/guide.md) for the relevant source and contracts.

## Current problem and next decision

The AnyIO observation/repair comparison is closed: A received the historical probe
program/question with a timeout receipt; B received the same program/question with
the completed lifecycle observation. Both started from the same saved incorrect
candidate with fresh budgets and the corrected environment for any new probes.
Acceptance was A 2/2 and B 2/2 planned; all four submitted and passed safety. There
were no NOT_RUN results, infrastructure stops or incomplete responses.

All four first reran the public lifecycle check, read the owning source, made one
new edit, passed the automatic lifecycle recheck and upstream regression, then
submitted. No new probe was requested. A recovered from the fresh check and source
without the completed operator observation. This small selected comparison shows
no acceptance advantage from supplying that observation and supports no new prompt
or planning rule. It does not establish general equivalence or spontaneous case
selection; completion guidance and repair-recheck were fixed controls.

The original cost-limited ON run remains NOT_RUN. It had asked a relevant probe
question after its failed check, but obtained no observation. These new seeded
runs reset both context and budget, so they cannot isolate the original failure's
cause or show that recovery would fit its remaining budget. The remaining question
is whether a fresh full solve, including initial investigation and candidate
generation, recovers within its original cap using the corrected probe environment.
That full-solve comparison has not been run here.

Use the selected pytest dependency bundle for subsequent AnyIO diagnostics;
top-level import success alone is not entry-point readiness. The earlier planning
OFF comparisons remain closed and separate: none is a simpler development option,
with no automatic adoption or change to this comparison's chosen baseline.
The current group spent $1.888192 of $4.80. Unused funds are closed; no paid
allocation, additional sample or continuation is active.

## Implemented and measured

The latest investigation used existing runtime and seeded-repair code for four live
model runs. All 26 actual inputs/count requests, continuation records, five journal
chains and frozen source/dependency identities verified; owned containers are absent.
Recovery is observed for this supplied candidate. End-to-end task-solving improvement
and default adoption remain unestablished.

The opt-in first-plan timing, declaration expansion and independent-candidate diagnostics
remain implemented, with no default adoption established by their closed comparisons.
The planning OFF comparison removes the explicit planning feature as a whole; bounded
working notes, internal reasoning and registered tools remain available.

## Reading and updating this page

At task start, read this page and the relevant implementation/operation section.
Search history only when a named failure, decision, or evidence gap needs it; read
the matching passage rather than whole snapshots. Historical "current", "latest",
"next", commands, and approvals describe their original checkpoint only.

Replace stale status here. Record a significant completed investigation once in
`docs/history/`, then keep only its current implication and evidence link here.
Do not append run-by-run results, validation totals, or superseded plans to this page.
Documentation size limits are checked by `tests/test_documentation_layout.py`.
