# Current status

Updated: 2026-09-28. This is a replaceable snapshot of current decisions, not an
append-only log. Source code owns runtime behavior; this page owns current priorities.
Read [history](history/README.md) only for a specific evidence question.

## Direction

Build an agent that understands public tasks, makes correct repairs, checks changed
and preserved behavior, and submits reliably within bounded cost and time. Start
with observed failures, diagnose causes, and select the smallest useful improvement.
Research questions can arise during diagnosis; reusable method claims follow evidence.
There is no commitment to demonstrate a memory effect or another preselected method.

Comparisons answer causal questions. Plumbing, note/probe use or submission alone
does not establish better task solving. Remove ineffective mechanisms when useful.

## Active runtime and working baseline

- `dev-head` is the sole active mutable runtime; every run is `official=false`.
- The chosen performance baseline is `gpt-5.4-2026-03-05`, xhigh, 25,000 output tokens.
  These selected settings are not a statement of CLI defaults.
- Baseline options: segmented-v1, result-or-size-v1 boundaries, brief-v1, probes
  enabled / probe-policy none, repair-recheck, protected-v1 inspection, and
  per-call-v1 completion-cost admission.
- Limits: 40 model calls, 100 tool actions, 4 accepted mutations, 1,800 seconds;
  paid work also needs an exact separately authorized invocation-wide cost cap.
- Cross-run memory, held-out tuning, and claim execution are disabled. Bounded
  run-local notes and public state remain available.
- Historical Rapid executables are absent. Existing history and evidence are immutable.

Keep the chosen baseline fixed while diagnosing a failure. Any proposed change
should identify the mechanism it tests; task-specific repair hints are excluded.
See [operations](operations.md) for commands and actual CLI defaults, and the
[implementation guide](../.agent/guide.md) for the relevant source and contracts.

## Current problem and next decision

The [cross-task audit](history/2026-09-28-cross-task-failure-analysis.md) reviewed
five recent fresh-run groups: 27 runs, eight task families. This is an imbalanced
retrospective inventory, not a success-rate estimate: 16 runs concern Pydantic/HF.
Original benchmark packages and adapted public task packages remain separate.

Close the toqito-specific investigation. Repeated use of a refuted mathematical
oracle is established on that task, not as the general dominant failure. AnyIO
shows an unmeasured premise promoted to a confirmed cause; Pydantic/HF show repair
applicability and verification-scope gaps. Successful Fromager, pgmpy, MontePy and
darts paths prevent interpreting absence of custom probes as failure by itself.
Environment readiness, failed candidate behavior and resource-limited NOT_RUN remain
separate axes. Public observations do not identify hidden evaluator failure causes.

Do not adopt the reconciliation cue. Pause the proposed float-setup guidance change;
its broader priority is unproven. The next evidence need is diverse fresh dev-train
tasks under a fixed harness, assessing evidence behind repair/preservation claims.
No new experiment or paid execution is authorized by the analysis-only audit.

Key closed evidence:

- [Original pilot](history/2026-09-28-original-pilot-results.md): MontePy/darts passed;
  toqito exhausted its cap before submission. Preparation passed for all three.
- [AnyIO fresh solves](history/2026-09-27-anyio-fresh-solve.md): one PASS, one resource
  NOT_RUN with corrected probe dependencies; calibration, not original benchmark score.
- [Toqito funded continuation](history/2026-09-28-probe-followup-results.md): supplied
  patch repair passed benchmark/safety; operator matrix 14/15, underflow remains.
  This is not an additional fresh solve.
- [Reconciliation result](history/2026-09-28-expectation-reconciliation-results.md):
  supported expectations A 0/2, B 1/2; no reliable effect. $0.871760, funds closed.
- [Earlier timeout](history/2026-09-28-expectation-review-results.md): billing of one
  interrupted call remains unknown, separately from later settled allocations.

All prior allocations are closed. Earlier supplied-candidate repairs, operator
replays and response-only samples remain separate from fresh solves. Planning
comparisons are closed; the selected working baseline above is unchanged.

## Implemented and measured

The checkpoint collector has live provider acceptance, exact delivery and separate
cost-accounting evidence for the closed interventions. Accepted continuations are
not fresh solves. The earlier N1/N2 fresh solves used unmodified run_dev with corrected
dependencies. Reliable recovery, general improvement and default adoption remain
unestablished; earlier supplied-candidate repairs remain separate evidence.

The opt-in first-plan timing, declaration expansion and independent-candidate diagnostics
remain implemented, with no default adoption established by their closed comparisons.
The planning OFF comparison removes the explicit planning feature as a whole; bounded
working notes, internal reasoning and registered tools remain available.

## Reading and updating this page

At task start, read this page and the relevant implementation/operation section.
Search history only when a named failure, decision, or evidence gap needs it; read
the matching passage rather than whole snapshots. Historical "current", "latest",
"next", commands, and approvals describe their original checkpoint only.

Replace stale status here. Record a significant completed investigation once in
`docs/history/`, then keep only its current implication and evidence link here.
Do not append run-by-run results, validation totals, or superseded plans to this page.
Documentation size limits are checked by `tests/test_documentation_layout.py`.
