# Current status

`dev-head` is the only active coding-agent runtime. It is mutable, development-only,
and always records `official=false`. The available commands are `patchloop dev`,
`patchloop doctor`, and `patchloop task validate`; legacy Rapid and provider-backed
claim commands are absent.

## Targets and limits

- focused local validation: under 2 minutes
- default one-row live limit: 1,800 seconds
- 40 model calls, 100 tool actions, and 4 accepted mutations
- one protocol/incomplete correction and at most 4 parallel reads
- `repeat=1` by default, 6 maximum, under one invocation-wide cost cap

## Authority

Mock execution carries no provider authority. One exact live `patchloop dev`
invocation authorizes only its declared `dev-train` task, model, credential file,
repeat count, and positive total cap. It never authorizes an image pull/build,
another task, an automatic retry after uncertainty, or a confirmatory claim run.

Repository policy alone never initiates paid work. The four live observations below
were separately authorized. None authorized an image pull/build, automatic
Docker startup, transport retry, or additional row.

## Evidence state

Ruff, the fast suite, and mock smoke pass. The current context-projection checkpoint
passed 29 tests in 16.45 seconds. The resume checkpoint passes 39 tests in 35.15
seconds. The provenance/safety checkpoint passes 54 tests in 50.43 seconds and
reaches mock `EVALUATOR_PASS` with task acceptance PASS and safety NOT_RUN. The
post-live mutation-encoding checkpoint passes Ruff and 56 tests in 50.92 seconds;
mock smoke reaches the same evaluator boundary through one accepted
`apply_git_diff` mutation. The failed-mutation continuation checkpoint passes Ruff
and 59 tests in 50.51 seconds; mock smoke still reaches that boundary. The hunk-recount
checkpoint passes Ruff and 62 tests in 55.10 seconds. Mock run
`run_dev_8ba03a7965a048c5` reaches `EVALUATOR_PASS` through one accepted mutation with
task acceptance PASS, safety NOT_RUN, `claim_eligible=false`, and zero model cost.
Read-only hydration of the third live journal recovers its full failed-diff hash,
hypothesis, `loguru/_handler.py` anchor, and patch line 27. The first live row ran on
2026-09-02:
`loguru-invalid-format-feedback`, `gpt-5.4-mini-2026-03-17`, medium reasoning,
one repetition, and a $1.20 invocation cap. Run `run_dev_e89e940c0715474e`
reached a durable `LIMIT_REACHED` terminal in 141.147 seconds after 39 model
calls and 99 successful read/search actions. It accepted no mutation, submitted
nothing, ran no evaluator, and recorded $0.07907685 of provider cost.

After the local reliability plan, a second separately approved row repeated the
same task, model, reasoning, repetition, and $1.20 cap. Run
`run_dev_9939bd27c5d04819` reached durable `LIMIT_REACHED` after 209.250 active
seconds, 40 model calls, and 92 tool actions, recording $0.25888155. All 39 prior
tool batches were present in the next context and 39 exact requests used the
evidence cache. Unlike the first row, the agent attempted mutation twice, on turns
36 and 39. Both attempts used `*** Begin Patch` wrappers and were rejected because
the runtime required a raw Git diff. It accepted no mutation, submitted nothing,
and ran no evaluator.

After the mutation wire contract was made explicit, a third separately approved
row again used the same task, model, reasoning, repetition, and $1.20 cap. Run
`run_dev_ef58e14b40834f0b` reached durable `LIMIT_REACHED` after 172.780 active
seconds, 40 model calls, and 94 tool actions, recording $0.24390525. On turn 3 the
agent called `apply_git_diff` with the required raw Git-diff prefix, so the renamed
provider tool contract was accepted. The first hunk declared 20 post-image lines
but contained 21, and fail-closed `git apply --check` rejected it at the following
hunk header with `corrupt patch at <stdin>:27`. That exact failure appeared in the
next canonical context. The remaining 37 turns returned to read/search only. No
mutation was accepted, nothing was submitted, and no evaluator ran.

After failed-mutation continuation was implemented, a fourth separately approved row
used the same task, model, reasoning, repetition, and cap. Run
`run_dev_dd7c981c6d024bcf` reached durable `LIMIT_REACHED` after 293.264 active
seconds, 40 model calls, and 72 tool actions, recording $0.343095. It attempted 13
raw-diff mutations. Every failure appeared exactly in the next context, and the
repair card remained present in all 23 turns after the first failure. All 13 diffs
still had incorrect hunk totals and none applied. A read-only
`git apply --check --recount` accepted all 13 exact diffs against the retained
isolated workspace; that establishes structural applicability after recount, not
semantic correctness. No visible check, submission, or evaluator ran.

The terminal arrived within 30 minutes, but the operational target still remains
unverified because there was no evaluator summary. See
[Evidence and limitations](evidence.md) for the exact observation and limits.

Historical executables are recoverable at checkpoint `b71ddeee`; immutable
historical artifacts and `docs/archive/` remain preserved. Current checkout
compatibility with those runners is intentionally unsupported.

## Next decision

The first live failure exposed a context-projection defect: successful reads were
selected by lexicographic span hash, so requested source could disappear from the
next stateless request and trigger repeated inspection. The second live row provides
bounded evidence that complete latest-batch projection and exact-request caching now
operate in a live loop. The third row confirmed raw-diff tool selection but exposed
failed-mutation displacement. The fourth row shows that displacement is fixed: the
agent kept seeing the exact failed diff and attempted 13 replacements. The remaining
failure was mechanical hunk-total arithmetic in every replacement.

The next seam is therefore deterministic hunk recount, not a stronger repeated-read
terminal or a replacement mutation interface. The local tool now uses Git recount
consistently for preview, application, rollback, and crash reconciliation.
Only declared totals are inferred from the hunk body; invalid syntax or source
context, stale evidence and anchors, forbidden or new paths, scope violations, and
final diff identity still fail closed. Repetition detection remains soft evidence.

Operational resume uses an immutable envelope, exact contract comparison,
run-lifetime locking, journal-derived counters and cost, durable tool-decision replay,
and mutation reconciliation. Pre-envelope runs remain immutable and non-resumable.
Runtime and task content are byte-bound; the manifest precedes evaluation; task
acceptance and safety remain separate typed axes. No fifth live row is authorized.

A confirmatory lane is not considered until three distinct tasks submit without a
harness/contract terminal and at least two privately pass. That threshold opens a
design review only; it does not support a quality or generalization claim.
