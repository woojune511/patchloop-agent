# Current status

`dev-head` is the only active coding-agent runtime. It is mutable, development-only,
and always records `official=false`. The available commands are `patchloop dev`,
`patchloop doctor`, and `patchloop task validate`; legacy Rapid and provider-backed
claim commands are absent.

## Targets and limits

- focused local validation: under 2 minutes
- default one-row live limit: 1,800 seconds
- 40 model calls, 100 tool actions, and 4 accepted mutations
- one consecutive protocol/incomplete correction and at most 4 parallel reads
- `repeat=1` by default, 6 maximum, under one invocation-wide cost cap

## Authority

Mock execution carries no provider authority. One exact live `patchloop dev`
invocation authorizes only its declared `dev-train` task, model, credential file,
repeat count, and positive total cap. It never authorizes an image pull/build,
another task, an automatic retry after uncertainty, or a confirmatory claim run.

Repository policy alone never initiates paid work. The six live observations below
were separately authorized. None authorized an image pull/build, automatic
Docker startup, transport retry, or additional row.

## Evidence state

Ruff, the fast suite, and mock smoke pass. The current context-projection checkpoint
passed 29 tests in 16.45 seconds. The resume checkpoint passes 39 tests in 35.15
seconds. The provenance/safety checkpoint passes 54 tests in 50.43 seconds and
reaches mock `EVALUATOR_PASS` with task acceptance PASS and safety NOT_RUN. The
post-live mutation-encoding checkpoint passes Ruff and 56 tests in 50.92 seconds;
mock smoke reaches the same evaluator boundary through one accepted
`apply_git_diff` mutation. The failed-mutation continuation checkpoint passes Ruff
and 59 tests in 50.51 seconds; mock smoke still reaches that boundary. The hunk-recount
checkpoint passes Ruff and 62 tests in 55.10 seconds. Mock run
`run_dev_8ba03a7965a048c5` reaches `EVALUATOR_PASS` through one accepted mutation with
task acceptance PASS, safety NOT_RUN, `claim_eligible=false`, and zero model cost.
Provider-free retrospective run `run_dev_replay_d1d2519dbd9644f9` replayed the
fourth live row's first exact raw diff through the current gateway. Recount accepted
the mutation, all three version-1 visible checks passed on canonical diff
`sha256:317ac609a2a9e555d0c38a5bf489c1dc68edd9c81457f598dbbf81fe3570d8c7`,
and the isolated evaluator applied that same diff. Task acceptance failed with
`PRIVATE_EVALUATION_FAILED` while safety passed. This separates mutation transport
from semantic task acceptance; it is not a fifth live row or a provider result.
A preserved version-1 task and new `loguru-invalid-format-feedback` version 2 now
make the central public behavior executable. In provider-free Docker validation,
the clean base and the retrospectively replayed patch both failed the new public
contract check, while a temporary public-contract correction passed all four
visible checks and reached `finish_task`. No hidden evaluator ran for that
validation. Ruff and all 63 tests pass in 54.28 seconds. Mock run
`run_dev_99bbb59c944d4c37` reaches `EVALUATOR_PASS` with task acceptance PASS,
safety NOT_RUN, `claim_eligible=false`, and zero model cost.
The post-fifth-row tool-alignment checkpoint passes Ruff and all 69 tests in
69.15 seconds. Mock run `run_dev_6374b31034c44427` reaches the same isolated
`EVALUATOR_PASS` boundary through one accepted mutation; this is provider-free
contract evidence only.
The sixth live row reached submission and isolated Docker evaluation. All four
visible checks, the submitted artifact, and the evaluator-applied patch shared diff
`sha256:e55b934c407a36807344f2f9e378c54c10283e407b063033972183ea0f43254f`.
Task acceptance reported FAIL while safety reported PASS, but the failure came from
a private literal-phrase assertion stricter than the public version-2 contract. This
is evaluator-contract evidence, not a valid negative coding-agent verdict.
Version 3 preserves every version-2 public behavior and unchanged fixture while
replacing only the private literal oracle with a semantic call-and-reference check.
Its task content hash is
`sha256:21f5f668c4f6ef85a2c1a45f4371cbd050de0e73dfcf8605a3c398413374c15b`.
Provider-free evaluator run `run_dev_v3candidate_f1bb` applied the sixth row's exact
submitted diff and reported hidden, regression, scope, and safety PASS. A separate
evaluator run `run_dev_v3reference` reports the same four-axis PASS for the reference.
A Docker matrix made the clean base fail and all six declared known-bad patches fail
acceptance. Ruff and all 70 tests pass; mock run
`run_dev_db9548d402084112` reaches `EVALUATOR_PASS` with zero model cost.
The subsequent import-contract checkpoint makes the `patchloop.dev` and
`patchloop.verifier` package re-exports lazy and gives the runner a direct evaluator
module dependency. Fresh-process regressions verify that package imports load neither
heavy module and that both `dev.contracts`-first and `verifier.policy`-first orders
work while preserving the public exports. Ruff and all 73 tests pass in 70.71 seconds;
mock run `run_dev_d309590128764086` reaches `EVALUATOR_PASS` with task acceptance
PASS, safety NOT_RUN, `claim_eligible=false`, and zero recorded cost.
Read-only hydration of the third live journal recovers its full failed-diff hash,
hypothesis, `loguru/_handler.py` anchor, and patch line 27. The first live row ran on
2026-09-02:
`loguru-invalid-format-feedback`, `gpt-5.4-mini-2026-03-17`, medium reasoning,
one repetition, and a $1.20 invocation cap. Run `run_dev_e89e940c0715474e`
reached a durable `LIMIT_REACHED` terminal in 141.147 seconds after 39 model
calls and 99 successful read/search actions. It accepted no mutation, submitted
nothing, ran no evaluator, and recorded $0.07907685 of provider cost.

After the local reliability plan, a second separately approved row repeated the
same task, model, reasoning, repetition, and $1.20 cap. Run
`run_dev_9939bd27c5d04819` reached durable `LIMIT_REACHED` after 209.250 active
seconds, 40 model calls, and 92 tool actions, recording $0.25888155. All 39 prior
tool batches were present in the next context and 39 exact requests used the
evidence cache. Unlike the first row, the agent attempted mutation twice, on turns
36 and 39. Both attempts used `*** Begin Patch` wrappers and were rejected because
the runtime required a raw Git diff. It accepted no mutation, submitted nothing,
and ran no evaluator.

After the mutation wire contract was made explicit, a third separately approved
row again used the same task, model, reasoning, repetition, and $1.20 cap. Run
`run_dev_ef58e14b40834f0b` reached durable `LIMIT_REACHED` after 172.780 active
seconds, 40 model calls, and 94 tool actions, recording $0.24390525. On turn 3 the
agent called `apply_git_diff` with the required raw Git-diff prefix, so the renamed
provider tool contract was accepted. The first hunk declared 20 post-image lines
but contained 21, and fail-closed `git apply --check` rejected it at the following
hunk header with `corrupt patch at <stdin>:27`. That exact failure appeared in the
next canonical context. The remaining 37 turns returned to read/search only. No
mutation was accepted, nothing was submitted, and no evaluator ran.

After failed-mutation continuation was implemented, a fourth separately approved row
used the same task, model, reasoning, repetition, and cap. Run
`run_dev_dd7c981c6d024bcf` reached durable `LIMIT_REACHED` after 293.264 active
seconds, 40 model calls, and 72 tool actions, recording $0.343095. It attempted 13
raw-diff mutations. Every failure appeared exactly in the next context, and the
repair card remained present in all 23 turns after the first failure. All 13 diffs
still had incorrect hunk totals and none applied. A read-only
`git apply --check --recount` accepted all 13 exact diffs against the retained
isolated workspace; that establishes structural applicability after recount, not
semantic correctness. No visible check, submission, or evaluator ran.

After hunk recount and the version-2 public contract were implemented, a fifth
separately approved row used the same model, reasoning, repetition, and $1.20 cap
on task version 2. Run `run_dev_329131da9a4940c3` reached durable
`PROTOCOL_VIOLATION` after 140.703 active seconds, 29 model calls, 55 tool actions,
one accepted mutation, and $0.1743726 of recorded cost. The contract, basic-format,
and patcher-field checks passed on that diff. The remaining
`upstream-format-regression` was not called before two completed provider responses
contained no function call, so no submission or evaluator followed. A later
provider-free run of that exact remaining public check against the retained diff
passed 20 tests. This is public check evidence only; it is not part of the immutable
live run and is not task acceptance.

After the tool contract was aligned, a sixth separately approved row used the same
version-2 task, model, reasoning, repetition, $1.20 cap, and external state root.
Run `run_dev_f1bb02f3e3154bb8` reached durable `EVALUATOR_FAIL` after 227.735 active
seconds and 229 seconds of run age. It made 38 model calls and 68 tool actions,
accepted one mutation, submitted one changed file, and recorded $0.26552445. All
provider responses contained at least one function call. All four visible checks
passed on the submitted diff, and the evaluator applied that identical artifact.
Regression and scope passed and typed Docker safety was PASS. Task acceptance failed
only because the private oracle required a particular example spelling even though
the public contract explicitly allowed equivalent wording. Version 2 therefore has
an acceptance-oracle mismatch and remains frozen as evidence.

The end-to-end live path reached an evaluator summary within the 30-minute row limit;
it did not produce a contract-valid task-acceptance result. See
[Evidence and limitations](evidence.md) for the exact observation and limits.

Historical executables are recoverable at checkpoint `b71ddeee`; immutable
historical artifacts and `docs/archive/` remain preserved. Current checkout
compatibility with those runners is intentionally unsupported.

## Next decision

The first live failure exposed a context-projection defect: successful reads were
selected by lexicographic span hash, so requested source could disappear from the
next stateless request and trigger repeated inspection. The second live row provides
bounded evidence that complete latest-batch projection and exact-request caching now
operate in a live loop. The third row confirmed raw-diff tool selection but exposed
failed-mutation displacement. The fourth row shows that displacement is fixed: the
agent kept seeing the exact failed diff and attempted 13 replacements. The fifth row
then confirmed live mutation and three public-check passes, but stopped before the
fourth public check and submission. The sixth row confirms required tool selection,
complete visible-check traversal, submission identity, evaluator execution, and typed
safety in one live path. Its task-acceptance failure instead exposes a version-2
public/private oracle mismatch.

Deterministic hunk recount remains the correct mutation-wire fix, not a stronger
repeated-read terminal or replacement mutation interface. The retrospective replay
now confirms that it accepts one exact provider-emitted diff while preserving the
canonical submission identity. That patch passed all version-1 visible checks but
failed task acceptance, exposing a later public-feedback boundary: those checks
covered valid-format regressions but did not execute the issue's missing-key and
catch behavior.

Task version 2 preserves version 1 and adds one black-box visible check derived only
from the public issue and repository API. It exercises actionable missing-key
feedback, available record-key reporting, the canonical `logger.bind()` /
`{extra[key]}` guidance, and both catch modes without requiring an implementation
shape or exact full sentence. Its task content hash is
`sha256:61704553b8ba733bad7350561eec397a7a6c04365a56ef61854a9e12cefe259d`.
The fifth and sixth rows used this exact identity. Version 3 preserves version 2 and
accepts the semantics promised publicly rather than one literal phrasing. The sixth
row's submitted patch passes the version-3 evaluator provider-free, but that does not
retroactively change the version-2 terminal or create a new live observation. No
seventh live row or retry is authorized.

The fifth row's terminal label described the application's tool-batch boundary, but
the stored evidence did not establish that the provider response itself was
malformed. Both
zero-tool responses completed and consumed output tokens, while the old adapter
discarded non-function output without recording its shape. More importantly, the
request allowed a zero-tool response even though the runner rejected one; the
context exposed only three recent checks rather than a complete current-diff status,
and every successful-check card incorrectly asked what the public “failure” had
falsified. The correction therefore aligns the request and runner with required
tool choice, projects all current check states and the exact remaining IDs, fixes
PASS guidance, records content-free response-shape metadata, and provides a
structured unsuccessful `stop_task`. Protocol recovery now counts consecutive
violations and resets after a valid tool batch. None of these changes reinterpret
the fifth row as a submission or evaluator result.

Operational resume uses an immutable envelope, exact contract comparison,
run-lifetime locking, journal-derived counters and cost, durable tool-decision replay,
and mutation reconciliation. Pre-envelope runs remain immutable and non-resumable.
Runtime and task content are byte-bound; the manifest precedes evaluation; task
acceptance and safety remain separate typed axes. No additional live row is
authorized.

The unrelated local import edge is now fixed. Package initialization no longer
eagerly imports the development runner or evaluator core, while the existing
`patchloop.dev.run_dev` and `patchloop.verifier.EvaluationEngine` exports resolve on
first access. The runner imports the concrete evaluator module directly. Fresh-process
tests cover both formerly order-dependent imports; no task, evaluator rule, or live
evidence changed.

A confirmatory lane is not considered until three distinct tasks submit without a
harness/contract terminal and at least two privately pass. That threshold opens a
design review only; it does not support a quality or generalization claim.
