# Current status

`dev-head` is the only active coding-agent runtime. It is mutable, development-only,
and always records `official=false`. The available commands are `patchloop dev`,
`patchloop doctor`, and `patchloop task validate`; legacy Rapid and provider-backed
claim commands are absent.

## Targets and limits

- focused local validation: under 2 minutes
- default one-row live limit: 1,800 seconds
- 40 model calls, 100 tool actions, and 4 accepted mutations
- one protocol/incomplete correction and at most 4 parallel reads
- `repeat=1` by default, 6 maximum, under one invocation-wide cost cap

## Authority

Mock execution carries no provider authority. One exact live `patchloop dev`
invocation authorizes only its declared `dev-train` task, model, credential file,
repeat count, and positive total cap. It never authorizes an image pull/build,
another task, an automatic retry after uncertainty, or a confirmatory claim run.

Repository policy alone never initiates paid work. No live provider or Docker
execution occurred during the reset or this documentation consolidation.

## Evidence state

Ruff, the fast suite, and mock smoke pass. The current context-projection checkpoint
passed 29 tests in 16.45 seconds. The resume checkpoint passes 39 tests in 35.15
seconds and reaches mock `EVALUATOR_PASS`. The first live row ran on 2026-09-02:
`loguru-invalid-format-feedback`, `gpt-5.4-mini-2026-03-17`, medium reasoning,
one repetition, and a $1.20 invocation cap. Run `run_dev_e89e940c0715474e`
reached a durable `LIMIT_REACHED` terminal in 141.147 seconds after 39 model
calls and 99 successful read/search actions. It accepted no mutation, submitted
nothing, ran no evaluator, and recorded $0.07907685 of provider cost.

The terminal arrived within 30 minutes, but the operational target still remains
unverified because there was no evaluator summary. See
[Evidence and limitations](evidence.md) for the exact observation and limits.

Historical executables are recoverable at checkpoint `b71ddeee`; immutable
historical artifacts and `docs/archive/` remain preserved. Current checkout
compatibility with those runners is intentionally unsupported.

## Next decision

The live failure was caused first by context projection: successful reads were
selected by lexicographic span hash, so requested source could disappear from the
next stateless request and trigger repeated inspection. The local checkpoint now
projects the complete latest tool batch, keeps a recency-ordered working set, caches
identical evidence, and emits only a soft stagnation signal. It also rejects new or
untracked submission files. Live behavior remains unverified and no second live run
is authorized. Operational resume now uses an immutable envelope, exact contract
comparison, run-lifetime locking, journal-derived counters and cost, durable
tool-decision replay, and mutation reconciliation. Pre-envelope runs remain
immutable and non-resumable. The next local seam is content provenance and typed
task-acceptance versus safety evidence.

A confirmatory lane is not considered until three distinct tasks submit without a
harness/contract terminal and at least two privately pass. That threshold opens a
design review only; it does not support a quality or generalization claim.
