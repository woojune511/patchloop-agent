# Current status

Updated: 2026-09-27. This is a replaceable snapshot of current decisions, not an
append-only log. Source code owns runtime behavior; this page owns current priorities.
Read [history](history/README.md) only for a specific evidence question.

## Direction

Build an agent that understands public tasks, makes correct repairs, checks changed
and preserved behavior, and submits reliably within bounded cost and time. Start
with observed failures, diagnose causes, and select the smallest useful improvement.
Research questions can arise during diagnosis; reusable method claims follow evidence.
There is no commitment to demonstrate a memory effect or another preselected method.

Comparisons answer concrete causal questions when needed. Successful plumbing,
note/probe use, or submission alone does not establish better task solving.
Simplifying an ineffective mechanism is a valid next step.

## Active runtime and working baseline

- `dev-head` is the sole active mutable runtime; every run is `official=false`.
- The chosen performance baseline is `gpt-5.4-2026-03-05`, xhigh, 25,000 output tokens.
  The latest checkpoint comparison used collector checkpoint `8da9e09`.
  These selected settings are not a statement of CLI defaults.
- Baseline options: segmented-v1, result-or-size-v1 boundaries, brief-v1, probes
  enabled / probe-policy none, repair-recheck, protected-v1 inspection, and
  per-call-v1 completion-cost admission.
- Limits: 40 model calls, 100 tool actions, 4 accepted mutations, 1,800 seconds;
  paid work also needs an exact separately authorized invocation-wide cost cap.
- Cross-run memory, held-out tuning, and claim execution are disabled. Bounded
  run-local notes and public state remain available.
- Historical Rapid executables are absent. Existing history and evidence are immutable.

Keep the chosen baseline fixed while diagnosing a failure. Any proposed change
should identify the mechanism it tests; task-specific repair hints are excluded.
See [operations](operations.md) for commands and actual CLI defaults, and the
[implementation guide](../.agent/guide.md) for the relevant source and contracts.

## Current problem and next decision

The fresh AnyIO v3 N1/N2 solves remain closed: N1 made two unsuccessful repairs
and stopped without submission; N2 submitted and passed isolated acceptance/safety.
Their $1.854949 of $2.40 allocation is closed. N1's first post-probe repair depended
on caller cancellation that the public probe had not measured.

The separately authorized checkpoint diagnostic is now closed. A preserves N1's
saved first post-probe/pre-edit request; B changes only two current guidance fields
to remove its mutation recommendation. Observations, tools, budgets and encrypted
history are retained; earlier exposure and other mutation cues remain. Four actual
continuations ran A1/B1/B2/A2. A1 and B1 submitted and passed acceptance/safety.
B2 and A2 reached their cost limits without submission: acceptance/safety NOT_RUN.
New spend was $3.039521 of $3.869852, excluding inherited usage. Unused $0.830331
is closed. No paid allocation, retry or continuation is active.

All four first actions were replace_text, with no new inspection/probe beforehand.
B1, B2 and A2 conditioned the first repair on the unmeasured caller-cancellation
assumption and failed the same three public interrupt cases. B1 recovered and passed.
B2 and A2 passed lifecycle on their second repairs but then hit the upstream
KeyboardInterrupt subprocess timeout. A2's third repair still failed upstream;
its earlier lifecycle PASS does not validate that final diff. B2's late probe observed
an exit path not returning. Its result, and A2's last failed check, reached a counted
next input but no subsequent generation because minimum dispatch no longer fit.

All 25 dispatched requests and 27 counted inputs verified against public projections,
with exact first A/B delivery and intact native continuation. Billing is known; all
13 new owned check/probe containers are absent. Docker admission passed after the
user started it. There was no count/transport/cleanup uncertainty or automatic retry.
These establish execution integrity, not model uptake or general repair quality.

This sample shows no observed benefit from removing the current recommendation;
do not adopt it or infer that all guidance is ineffective. Each arm has one accepted
submission and one resource-limited non-submission, not one accepted and one rejected
patch. Next question: can a provider-free public observation directly distinguish
caller cancellation from callback interruption before another repair or paid policy
comparison? The plain-fixture explicit-cancel same-task assertion gap remains a
separate public coverage limit. Historical allocations and outcomes remain unchanged.

Earlier supplied-candidate A/B repairs remain a separate 2/2 acceptance per arm,
with no observed advantage from supplied completed output. Their operator probes
and B1 branch deletion establish only those saved candidates' measured behaviors.
They are not fresh-solve controls; earlier NOT_RUN outcomes remain unchanged.
Use the selected pytest dependency bundle for further AnyIO diagnostics. The
planning OFF comparisons remain closed without automatic adoption or baseline change.

## Implemented and measured

The checkpoint collector now has live provider acceptance, exact delivery and
separate cost-accounting evidence. Its two accepted continuations are not fresh
solves. The earlier N1/N2 fresh solves used unmodified run_dev with corrected
dependencies. Reliable recovery, general improvement and default adoption remain
unestablished; earlier supplied-candidate repairs remain separate evidence.

The opt-in first-plan timing, declaration expansion and independent-candidate diagnostics
remain implemented, with no default adoption established by their closed comparisons.
The planning OFF comparison removes the explicit planning feature as a whole; bounded
working notes, internal reasoning and registered tools remain available.

## Reading and updating this page

At task start, read this page and the relevant implementation/operation section.
Search history only when a named failure, decision, or evidence gap needs it; read
the matching passage rather than whole snapshots. Historical "current", "latest",
"next", commands, and approvals describe their original checkpoint only.

Replace stale status here. Record a significant completed investigation once in
`docs/history/`, then keep only its current implication and evidence link here.
Do not append run-by-run results, validation totals, or superseded plans to this page.
Documentation size limits are checked by `tests/test_documentation_layout.py`.
