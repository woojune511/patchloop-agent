# Current status

Updated: 2026-09-27. This is a replaceable snapshot of current decisions, not an
append-only log. Source code owns runtime behavior; this page owns current priorities.
Read [history](history/README.md) only for a specific evidence question.

## Direction

Build an agent that understands public tasks, makes correct repairs, checks changed
and preserved behavior, and submits reliably within bounded cost and time. Start
with observed failures, diagnose causes, and select the smallest useful improvement.
Research questions can arise during diagnosis; reusable method claims follow evidence.
There is no commitment to demonstrate a memory effect or another preselected method.

Comparisons answer concrete causal questions when needed. Successful plumbing,
note/probe use, or submission alone does not establish better task solving.
Simplifying an ineffective mechanism is a valid next step.

## Active runtime and working baseline

- `dev-head` is the sole active mutable runtime; every run is `official=false`.
- The chosen performance baseline is `gpt-5.4-2026-03-05`, xhigh, 25,000 output tokens.
  The latest information comparison used collector checkpoint `dcacb0d`.
  These selected settings are not a statement of CLI defaults.
- Baseline options: segmented-v1, result-or-size-v1 boundaries, brief-v1, probes
  enabled / probe-policy none, repair-recheck, protected-v1 inspection, and
  per-call-v1 completion-cost admission.
- Limits: 40 model calls, 100 tool actions, 4 accepted mutations, 1,800 seconds;
  paid work also needs an exact separately authorized invocation-wide cost cap.
- Cross-run memory, held-out tuning, and claim execution are disabled. Bounded
  run-local notes and public state remain available.
- Historical Rapid executables are absent. Existing history and evidence are immutable.

Keep the chosen baseline fixed while diagnosing a failure. Any proposed change
should identify the mechanism it tests; task-specific repair hints are excluded.
See [operations](operations.md) for commands and actual CLI defaults, and the
[implementation guide](../.agent/guide.md) for the relevant source and contracts.

## Current problem and next decision

The caller-information comparison is closed. Four actual continuations of N1's
first post-probe/pre-edit checkpoint ran A1/B1/B2/A2. A retained the original input;
B received the later operator probe code and raw caller-state measurements once.
Original mutation advice, tools, native history and remaining budgets were fixed.
New spend was $3.025955 of $3.869852, excluding inherited usage. Unused $0.843897
is closed. No paid allocation, retry or continuation is active.

All four first actions were replace_text. A1/A2 relied on caller cancellation and
failed the same three interrupt cases. B1/B2 added synchronous interrupted-run_test
handling that does not depend solely on caller cancellation. B2's public plan
explicitly distinguished callback interruption from caller cancellation. B2 passed
both public checks and isolated acceptance/safety with its first patch. B1's first
patch instead timed out during fixture cleanup; its second reintroduced resumed
test execution, and its third passed lifecycle but never ran the upstream check.

A1 recovered on its second patch and passed acceptance/safety. A2's second patch
stopped observed post-interrupt execution but timed out before fixture cleanup.
B1/A2 ended at the cost limit without submission: acceptance/safety NOT_RUN.
B1's last generated response exhausted its 177-token ceiling; A2 had reasoning-only
incomplete responses at 25,000 and later 488 tokens. Both final correction inputs
were counted but could not be dispatched. These are resource-limited outcomes,
not evaluator rejections or evidence that the model ignored undelivered feedback.

All 21 dispatched and 23 counted inputs verified against public projections,
including exact first-input evidence and no automatic later injection. Billing is
known; all 10 new owned check containers are absent. No new probe was executed.
The observed first-patch distinction is a local information-to-action signal;
each arm still has one accepted submission and one unsubmitted run. Do not adopt
a default prompt policy or claim general improvement from this selected checkpoint.

Next question: why did B1's first patch block cleanup while B2's first patch
completed it? A bounded provider-free inspection/probe of those saved public
patches can discriminate repeated cancellation from failure to drain pending work.
Those are hypotheses, not measured causes. No new probe/comparison is authorized
or executed by this closure, and no memory mechanism is prescribed.

The original caller-state observation applies to callback KeyboardInterrupt on
the unchanged base in the pinned environment, not every SIGINT/cancellation path.
The plain-fixture explicit-cancel same-task assertion gap remains: the operator
control cancels the waiting caller rather than the public check's test coroutine.
Earlier fresh N1/N2 solves and advice-removal comparison are separate closed
evidence; their budgets, outcomes and historical artifacts remain unchanged.

Earlier supplied-candidate A/B repairs remain a separate 2/2 acceptance per arm,
with no observed advantage from supplied completed output. Their operator probes
and B1 branch deletion establish only those saved candidates' measured behaviors.
They are not fresh-solve controls; earlier NOT_RUN outcomes remain unchanged.
Use the selected pytest dependency bundle for further AnyIO diagnostics. The
planning OFF comparisons remain closed without automatic adoption or baseline change.

## Implemented and measured

The checkpoint collector has live provider acceptance, exact delivery and separate
cost-accounting evidence for both closed interventions. Accepted continuations are
not fresh solves. The earlier N1/N2 fresh solves used unmodified run_dev with corrected
dependencies. Reliable recovery, general improvement and default adoption remain
unestablished; earlier supplied-candidate repairs remain separate evidence.

The opt-in first-plan timing, declaration expansion and independent-candidate diagnostics
remain implemented, with no default adoption established by their closed comparisons.
The planning OFF comparison removes the explicit planning feature as a whole; bounded
working notes, internal reasoning and registered tools remain available.

## Reading and updating this page

At task start, read this page and the relevant implementation/operation section.
Search history only when a named failure, decision, or evidence gap needs it; read
the matching passage rather than whole snapshots. Historical "current", "latest",
"next", commands, and approvals describe their original checkpoint only.

Replace stale status here. Record a significant completed investigation once in
`docs/history/`, then keep only its current implication and evidence link here.
Do not append run-by-run results, validation totals, or superseded plans to this page.
Documentation size limits are checked by `tests/test_documentation_layout.py`.
