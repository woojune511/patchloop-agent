# Current status

Updated: 2026-09-27. This is a replaceable snapshot of current decisions, not an
append-only log. Source code owns runtime behavior; this page owns current priorities.
Read [history](history/README.md) only for a specific evidence question.

## Direction

Build an agent that understands public tasks, makes correct repairs, checks changed
and preserved behavior, and submits reliably within bounded cost and time. Start
with observed failures, diagnose causes, and select the smallest useful improvement.
Research questions can arise during diagnosis; reusable method claims follow evidence.
There is no commitment to demonstrate a memory effect or another preselected method.

Comparisons answer concrete causal questions when needed. Successful plumbing,
note/probe use, or submission alone does not establish better task solving.
Simplifying an ineffective mechanism is a valid next step.

## Active runtime and working baseline

- `dev-head` is the sole active mutable runtime; every run is `official=false`.
- The chosen performance baseline is `gpt-5.4-2026-03-05`, xhigh, 25,000 output tokens.
  The latest information comparison used collector checkpoint `dcacb0d`.
  These selected settings are not a statement of CLI defaults.
- Baseline options: segmented-v1, result-or-size-v1 boundaries, brief-v1, probes
  enabled / probe-policy none, repair-recheck, protected-v1 inspection, and
  per-call-v1 completion-cost admission.
- Limits: 40 model calls, 100 tool actions, 4 accepted mutations, 1,800 seconds;
  paid work also needs an exact separately authorized invocation-wide cost cap.
- Cross-run memory, held-out tuning, and claim execution are disabled. Bounded
  run-local notes and public state remain available.
- Historical Rapid executables are absent. Existing history and evidence are immutable.

Keep the chosen baseline fixed while diagnosing a failure. Any proposed change
should identify the mechanism it tests; task-specific repair hints are excluded.
See [operations](operations.md) for commands and actual CLI defaults, and the
[implementation guide](../.agent/guide.md) for the relevant source and contracts.

## Current problem and next decision

The caller-information comparison is closed. Four actual continuations of N1's
first post-probe/pre-edit checkpoint ran A1/B1/B2/A2. A retained the original input;
B received the later operator probe code and raw caller-state measurements once.
Original mutation advice, tools, native history and remaining budgets were fixed.
New spend was $3.025955 of $3.869852, excluding inherited usage. Unused $0.843897
is closed. No paid allocation, retry or continuation is active.

The closed comparison produced one accepted submission and one resource-limited
non-submission per arm. B2 passed both checks with its first patch; B1's first patch
stalled during cleanup. Exact delivery and known billing were audited. These are
local information-to-action observations, not a general quality improvement.
See the results record for first repairs, intermediate failures and budget outcomes.

The subsequent provider-free diagnostic identified B1's cleanup stall in the
callback/ContextVar-fixture reproduction. run_test cancels the future and runner;
the waiting caller receives CancelledError from that future with cancelling() == 0,
then unconditionally cancels the runner again. The runner had returned to receiving
work outside its per-coroutine exception handler; it terminates, stranding teardown.
Both traced and untraced B1 executions stalled. Both B2 executions completed.
Removing only B1's caller-side runner.cancel line rescued both traced and untraced
executions: no post_interrupt, exactly one same-task fixture cleanup, normal exit.
Six isolated probes completed with known cleanup and zero provider calls/cost.

This is a measured local mechanism and one-line rescue, not a validated task repair.
The rescued runner still had cancelling() == 1 after teardown, so a nonzero counter
alone does not explain the stall. Cancellation origin and delivery point matter.
The active question is whether giving the agent these raw measurements helps it
repair B1 after its first failed check. A retains that saved input; B adds only
traced/untraced program and raw observations of the exact first candidate. B2,
one-line rescue and interpreted causal verdict are excluded. Actual caller.cancel()
preservation remains a validation question; new acceptance is NOT_RUN.
The new four-row comparison retains the original remaining resources;
no fresh paid allocation has been authorized. See the
[contract](../.agent/cleanup-information.md) and
[preparation evidence](history/2026-09-27-cleanup-information-preparation.md).
No default harness/prompt/memory policy or historical candidate has been changed.

The original caller-state observation applies to callback KeyboardInterrupt on
the unchanged base in the pinned environment, not every SIGINT/cancellation path.
The plain-fixture explicit-cancel same-task assertion gap remains: the operator
control cancels the waiting caller rather than the public check's test coroutine.
Earlier fresh N1/N2 solves and advice-removal comparison are separate closed
evidence; their budgets, outcomes and historical artifacts remain unchanged.

Earlier supplied-candidate A/B repairs remain a separate 2/2 acceptance per arm,
with no observed advantage from supplied completed output. Their operator probes
and B1 branch deletion establish only those saved candidates' measured behaviors.
They are not fresh-solve controls; earlier NOT_RUN outcomes remain unchanged.
Use the selected pytest dependency bundle for further AnyIO diagnostics. The
planning OFF comparisons remain closed without automatic adoption or baseline change.

## Implemented and measured

The checkpoint collector has live provider acceptance, exact delivery and separate
cost-accounting evidence for both closed interventions. Accepted continuations are
not fresh solves. The earlier N1/N2 fresh solves used unmodified run_dev with corrected
dependencies. Reliable recovery, general improvement and default adoption remain
unestablished; earlier supplied-candidate repairs remain separate evidence.

The opt-in first-plan timing, declaration expansion and independent-candidate diagnostics
remain implemented, with no default adoption established by their closed comparisons.
The planning OFF comparison removes the explicit planning feature as a whole; bounded
working notes, internal reasoning and registered tools remain available.

## Reading and updating this page

At task start, read this page and the relevant implementation/operation section.
Search history only when a named failure, decision, or evidence gap needs it; read
the matching passage rather than whole snapshots. Historical "current", "latest",
"next", commands, and approvals describe their original checkpoint only.

Replace stale status here. Record a significant completed investigation once in
`docs/history/`, then keep only its current implication and evidence link here.
Do not append run-by-run results, validation totals, or superseded plans to this page.
Documentation size limits are checked by `tests/test_documentation_layout.py`.
