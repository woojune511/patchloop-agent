# Implementation evidence — 2026-07-24

This is a local implementation checkpoint, not the planned core experiment result.

## Executed gates

| Gate | Command | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lock consistency | `uv lock --check` | pass, 78 packages resolved |
| Static analysis | `uv run ruff check .` | pass |
| Tests | `uv run pytest -q -ra` | 64 pass, including Docker isolation and dev-train task boundary tests |
| Package build | `uv build` | sdist and wheel built |
| Task contract | `patchloop task validate tasks/<split>/<task>` | all four audited packages pass |
| Dataset audit | `patchloop dataset audit` | expected incomplete: 4/23, smoke 3/3, dev-train 1/6 |
| Docker build | pinned base, `--network=none --provenance=false`, repeated twice | stable image ID in 2/2 builds |
| Docker isolation | network, UID, read-only workspace, host secret | all pass |
| Evaluator | three references plus 14 bad patches on Docker | all references pass; every bad patch rejected; all `official=true` |
| Offline agent smoke | three tasks × mock/replay on Docker | 6/6 SCRR pass, complete trace, all `official=true` |
| Offline campaign | `patchloop evaluate --suite experiments/smoke.yaml` | 1/1 completed, 0 infra errors |
| Report regeneration | `patchloop report --experiment offline-smoke ...` | JSON/CSV/HTML and portable evidence bundle |
| Viewer routes | six ASGI route requests | all HTTP 200 |
| Portable bundle scan | username, absolute workspace, private/reference path scan | pass |

Latest bundled offline run: `run_671aa408ac4241ca`.

- SCRR: pass
- hidden: pass
- regression: pass
- scope: pass
- official: false
- model calls: 5 mock calls
- tool calls: 4
- measured active wall time: 1,144 ms

The one-task bootstrap interval `[1.0, 1.0]` is mechanically correct but not inferentially useful. It must
not be presented as benchmark evidence.

## Official offline agent smoke evidence

Commit `1ea257cbbcc2ce131b5c09508f6df8c62ed23ed8` was run against the pinned Docker evaluator.
Each of the three smoke tasks completed once with the task-aware mock and once with its checked-in,
content-hashed replay.

| Task | Mock run | Replay run | Observed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `csv-quoted-newline` | `run_5cd7103a1c6f4d7a` | `run_c468655d03ed4d08` | 2/2 SCRR pass, `official=true` |
| `config-falsy-override` | `run_1492e28b07dd4feb` | `run_403b92ac32264725` | 2/2 SCRR pass, `official=true` |
| `path-prefix-boundary` | `run_27339c856bee4242` | `run_bd06edd18bc9434f` | 2/2 SCRR pass, `official=true` |

Every accepted run records five model calls, four tool calls, five rebuilt contexts, one `PatchApplied`,
one `RunCompleted` and a final `DONE` checkpoint. Persisted `result.json` usage equals SQLite state.
The context scan found no hidden check ID or reference-patch locator; the first context also excludes the
private reference hash. Replay manifests bind the repository-relative JSONL path to its SHA-256.

The machine-readable [offline agent smoke summary](../reports/offline-agent-smoke/summary.json) records
run IDs plus manifest, result, provenance, submitted-patch, event-stream and checkpoint hashes. It also
keeps an exclusion ledger for one non-official Docker-daemon diagnostic run and six pre-fix runs whose
persisted result artifact omitted agent usage. Those runs were not counted in the 6/6 gate.

These are deterministic scripted runs with zero API calls and zero model cost. They establish harness,
trace and evaluator behavior; they are not evidence of live-model quality or memory effectiveness.

## Official Docker evaluator evidence

The pinned base image is
`python:3.12-slim@sha256:57cd7c3a7a273101a6485ba99423ee568157882804b1124b4dd04266317710de`.
Two network-disabled builds with BuildKit provenance disabled produced the same evaluator image ID:
`sha256:5d430c8dbf2e1222148909ed4c79c3cbf212aa25a94c8c2d0cbd0a97adfccf1f`.

| Fixture | Final run | Expected boundary | Observed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference | `run_251d172b049e49c3` | full success | success |
| no-op | `run_8da6d410add948e4` | hidden fail | rejected |
| regression | `run_9b86d529fd57493b` | regression fail | rejected |
| forbidden path | `run_9328887b3bfc4d12` | scope fail | rejected |
| dependency | `run_e68390d517824e4b` | dependency/scope fail | rejected |
| test tampering | `run_2f57822c729348c1` | tampering/scope fail | rejected |
| public API | `run_a7771fc59af24470` | public-API/scope fail | rejected |

The machine-readable [Docker gate summary](../reports/docker-gate/summary.json) records the immutable
manifest, result and provenance hashes for these runs. This evidence covers one smoke task, not the planned
held-out dataset or model campaign.

Every final Docker gate manifest records baseline commit
`cf38649bbbf458316f38e64a579fd0196c782237`; no run in the machine-readable summary uses an uncommitted
harness identifier.

## Smoke task expansion evidence

Two additional independently content-addressed snapshots were frozen in commit
`024a3a375dc9514be6d127199d10f7115659eecf`.

| Task | Reference run | Known-bad corpus | Observed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `config-falsy-override` | `run_57c437c24e154317` | no-op, partial falsey fix, regression, forbidden path | reference passed; 4/4 rejected |
| `path-prefix-boundary` | `run_395efa14bc7c4e59` | no-op, boundary-only fix, regression, forbidden path | reference passed; 4/4 rejected |

All ten expansion runs record the task commit and the same pinned evaluator image as the CSV gate. The
[smoke expansion summary](../reports/docker-gate/smoke-expansion.json) records task/spec hashes, run IDs
and manifest/result/provenance hashes. Together, the three smoke tasks cover parser state, merge semantics
and path normalization without sharing a solution.

## First dev-train task admission

`duration-minute-boundary` is the first `dev-train` package. Its immutable snapshot keeps exact-minute
and sub-minute visible behavior working while deliberately rounding incomplete minute buckets upward.
The private acceptance checks values inside and near the end of those buckets.

| Patch | Run | Expected boundary | Observed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference | `run_4c333240f3ae4a26` | full success | success, `official=true` |
| no-op | `run_02cdf575981042d5` | hidden fail | rejected |
| near-miss | `run_18b131fb74a84d1a` | hidden fail | rejected |
| regression | `run_51bc997fa1394e20` | visible regression fail | rejected |
| forbidden path | `run_a5b492be61d2433d` | hidden and scope fail | rejected |

All five manifests record clean harness commit `6152e9b207ee615f5c1dd0ec8dbefc09f075f951`
and the pinned evaluator image. The machine-readable
[dev-train task gate](../reports/docker-gate/dev-train-duration-minute-boundary.json) records task/spec,
patch, manifest, result and provenance hashes. This admission is dataset evidence, not a model run; it
made zero API calls and does not create a memory entry. A clean clone reproduced the declared snapshot
hash `sha256:a3508607ed05735c39f766580002fa29801440ee66301fbc85b1525114f079fe`.

## Recovery evidence

Both automated E2E and a CLI-derived run were exercised. The run was suspended immediately after the
durable patch checkpoint, resumed, reached the hidden evaluator and retained exactly one `PatchApplied`
event. Checkpoint/worktree hash corruption is separately rejected by test.

## Open gates

`patchloop doctor` now passes with authenticated `gh`, WSL2, Docker Desktop and the pinned evaluator image;
`official_evaluation_ready=true`. `patchloop dataset audit` still intentionally exits non-zero: 4 of 23
packages exist and 0 of 6 OSS tasks is selected. The smoke split is complete at 3/3 and dev-train is 1/6.
No live OpenAI request or paid campaign was made.
