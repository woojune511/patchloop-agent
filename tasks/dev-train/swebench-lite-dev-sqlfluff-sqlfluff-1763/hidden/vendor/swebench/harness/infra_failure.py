"""Post-hoc classification of infrastructure failures (#586).

Separates "the environment broke" from "the model's patch was wrong" using
signatures in logs the harness already writes, so a broken image is not silently
counted as a model failure.

Two properties are deliberate:

1. Classification is post-hoc and read-only. It never runs commands in a
   container and never decides whether an instance gets evaluated, so it cannot
   drop an instance from a run.
2. It is advisory. A flagged instance stays in `unresolved_ids` / `error_ids`
   exactly as before, so the scoring denominator is unchanged.
